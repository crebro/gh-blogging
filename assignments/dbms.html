    <h3>1. Data</h3>
    <p>
      Data refers to raw facts and figures that have not yet been processed or
      interpreted. It can be numbers, text, images, or other forms of input
      that, when processed, provide meaningful information.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Information</h3>
    <p>
      Information is processed data that is meaningful and useful for making
      decisions. It is data that has been organized, analyzed, and interpreted
      to provide context and understanding.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Metadata</h3>
    <p>
      Metadata is data that describes other data. It provides information about
      a certain item's content, quality, condition, and other characteristics.
      For example, metadata for a data file might include information about when
      and by whom it was created, its size, and its format.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data Dictionary</h3>
    <p>
      A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or
      items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who need
      to refer to them. It contains metadata about the structure of the
      database, its tables, fields, and relationships.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Database</h3>
    <p>
      A database is an organized collection of structured information or data,
      typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is
      managed by a database management system (DBMS).
    </p>

    <h3>6. Table</h3>
    <p>
      A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within
      a database. It consists of rows and columns; each row represents a unique
      record, and each column represents a field in the record.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Tuples</h3>
    <p>
      Tuples, also known as records or rows, are the individual entries in a
      table. Each tuple represents a single, implicitly structured data item in
      a table.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Fields, also known as columns or attributes, are the individual pieces of
      data within a record. Each field represents a specific type of data, such
      as a name, date, or number.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Domains</h3>
    <p>
      Domains define the permissible values for a given attribute or field. They
      specify the data type, format, and constraints that apply to the data
      values stored in that field.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Constraints</h3>
    <p>
      Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a table. They ensure the
      accuracy and reliability of the data within the database. Common
      constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and
      check constraints.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Keys</h3>
    <p>
      Keys are attributes or sets of attributes that are used to uniquely
      identify a tuple (record) in a table. Primary keys uniquely identify each
      record, while foreign keys are used to link tables together.
