      <h1>Database Models</h1>

      <p>
        The different way in which databases and be structured are known as
        database models. It is the collection of conceptual tools for describing
        data in a database.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Hierarchical Model</h3>
      <p>
        The hierarchical model organizes data in a tree-like structure in which
        there is a single parent for each record. This model is best suited for
        one-to-many relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here the data is structuered into a tree-like strucutre, with a single
        root, to which all other data is connected. Each parent can have
        multiple children, but each child can have only one parent.
      </p>

          alt="Hierarchical Database Model"
        />
      </p>
      <h3>2. Network Database Model</h3>
      <p>
        The network database model allows each record to have multiple parent
        and child records, creating a more flexible structure. This model is
        best suited for many-to-many relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        In network database models, each child can have multiple parents. Thus,
        there is a greater flexibility in the structure of the data. This model
        was the precursor to the relational database model.

      </p>
      <h3>3. Relational Database Model</h3>
      <p>
        The relational database model organizes data into tables, with each
        table consisting of rows and columns. This model is best suited for
        complex data relationships and is the most widely used database model
        today.

      <h2>Relationships in SQL</h2>

      <p>
        In SQL, relationships are defined between tables using foreign keys. A
        foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references
        the primary key columns in another table. This establishes a link
        between the two tables.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Relationships (briefly defined)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>One-to-One</li>
        <p>
          In a one to one relationship each record in a table is linked to a
          single record from another table and vice versa. This type of
          relationship is not very common but is used when data is required to
          be split in one to one forms.
        </p>
        <li>One-to-Many</li>
        <p>
          In a one to many relationship a single entity in a database is allowed
          to be related to multiple entities. This type of relationship is the
          most common type of relationship in a database.
        </p>
        <p>eg. (many) orders can be issued by (single) user.</p>
        <li>Many-To-Many</li>
        <p>
          In a many to many relationship, multple records can be related to
          multiple records in another table. This type of relationship requires
          a junction or a pivot table to contain relationship links. Examples:
          (single) student can be ignored in (many) courses, and (single) course
          can have (mutliple) enrolees.
        </p>
      </ul>
